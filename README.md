# calculate-date
This calculator gives the difference between two dates in years, months, and
days, and determines the date at which two people met the xkcd "half your age
plus seven" rule.

The "seven years" is counted as exactly 2557 days (in other words, it includes
two leap years). The formula can be thought of as `(younger person's birthdate) +
(gap) + (14 years)`.
